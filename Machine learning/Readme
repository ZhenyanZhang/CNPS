#Codes here were used for machine learning with random forest algorithm.

#Machine learning model building and assessing
#Codes for machine learning model building and assessing with the accuracy

#ROC and Importance
#Codes for ROC plot visualization to confirm the performance of the final model
#Codes for determing the relative importance of each factors

#Confusion matrix
#Codes for confusion matrix to confirm the performance of the final model

#Prediction based on the best model
#Codes for prediction based on the best model

#Prediction based on the best model_list
#Codes for prediction based on the best model with a series of datasets (which can be placed in input path and the results of prediction will generated in the output path one by one).

#Demo
#Demos are provided here after necessary modification
